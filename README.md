# IoTrack
IoT Bluetooth Tracking Software Repository

Uses Silicon Labs BG22 devices with their AoA (Angle of Arrival) library to determine bluetooth devices locations with cm accuracy. 

This project has a BG22 device that sends out bluetooth 5.1 data packets with the included AoA information. Another BG22 device can then recieve the information and determine the distance and angle to the original BG22. The SSv5 project should load into Simplicity studio 5 and can be loaded onto a BG22 device.
