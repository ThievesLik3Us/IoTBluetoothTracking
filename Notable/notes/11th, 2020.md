# Notes for October 10th/11th, 2020

Today I am trying to accomplish the following:
- Connect Android Multicast to Laptop Multicast
- Test the script on the RockPi


## Connecting the Android Multicast to Laptop Multicast
I am currently running into an issue where it seems that the Laptop is able to send and receive Multicast messages
generated by the Laptop, but the Android is not able to send or receive any messages to the Laptop.
There are two possible reasons for this:
- Android App Multicast doesn't work as well as it seems to be
- The Laptop is broadcasting messages on a local connection and the Android is on the Local Area Network and can't see these messages

Currently I am using Wireshark to try and narrow down what the actual issue is.

It seems the Android side does not send or receive any multicast packets. I believe the issue is that the android system si stopping it and I need to acquire the multicast lock to send/receive signals. Also the RockPi side broadcast on a Local Connection 1 and not on WiFi which might also be an issue.
