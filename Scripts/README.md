# Scripts
This folder is a collection of useful python scripts for different automation that we are doing so if you make
a pyhon script to automate something, throw it in here a write a short description on how to use it.

## convert_sdk2_to_sdk3.py
This python script will take any SDK 2 file written for Simplicity Studio 4 and will convert it to SDK3 for
Simplicity Studio 5. It is a basic script that only does the 1:1 conversions but this will cover about 90-95%
of the code. The rest is up to the developer to switch and decide what is the best function to use.
Below is an example of how to use the script
```
$python3 convert_sdk2_to_sdk3.py app.c
```
